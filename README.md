# My-decentralised-Blog

This Blog is a way to organise all my threads/articles that I write on different platforms - Twitter, LinkedIn, GFG, Medium and put them at one place.
The Blog - 'THE PASSION PAD' is decentralised and all the files are uploaded on the Inter Planetary File System. I am 
an avid reader and you will often find me summarising a Book in a long Twitter thread - Yes that's who I am, have fun experiencing Yatharthism!
I have also added a list of the Books I have read and the goal is to assimilate as much knowledge as I can while I exist to suffer!
The topics include - Blockchain, Decentralisation, Money and sometimes Philosophical!(Yup.. No Love Stories sadly!) DM's are always open for the suggestions.
